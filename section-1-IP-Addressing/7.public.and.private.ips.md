# Public and Private IP Addresses

- Not all addresses can be freely used

- Some IP addresses are reserved for specific use:
	- 0.0.0.0 (default route)
	- 255.255.255.255 (default broadcast)
	- 127.0.0.0/8 (local host)
	- 169.254.0.0/16 (APIPA)

**RFC 1918** defines three private network ranges:
	- 10.0.0.0/8
	- 172.16.0.0/12 
	- 192.168.0.0/16

These three ranges arent routable on the internet. NAT will translate private IP's to public.
