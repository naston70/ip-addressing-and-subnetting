# Ipv4 Classes

At the beginning of the internet it was always assumed that it would be possible to group networks into groupings of small, medium or large networks. 

The idea behind classes was to give large networks class A, medium class B and small a class C IP range

Large Network  : Class A - N.H.H.H

Medium Network : Class B - N.N.H.H

Small Network  : Class C - N.N.N.H

================================================
### Class A - large networks

- Example : 71.3.99.2

- Network Address   : 71.0.0.0
- Broadcast Address : 71.255.255.255

- RANGE OF CLASS A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
================================================

### Class B - medium networks

- Example : 155.8.101.33

- Network Address   : 155.8.0.0
- Broadcast Address : 155.8.255.255

- RANGE OF CLASS B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
================================================

### Class C - small network

- Example : 201.65.4.137

- Network Address   : 201.64.4.0
- Broadcast Address : 201.64.4.255

- RANGE OF CLASS C: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
