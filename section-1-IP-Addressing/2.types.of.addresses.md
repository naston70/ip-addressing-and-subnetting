# Types of Addresses

#### Computer Addresses:

TCP/IP MODEL

Application  

Transport	---->	Port Numbers

Network		---->	IP Address

Physcial	---->	MAC Address

An IP Address is a logical identifier of a host on a given network, a MAC is a physical identifier. 

A layer 2 switch uses MAC addresses

Port numbers help us identify services running on a certain host. 

#### IPv6

IPv6 was developed as a solution to the shortage of IPv4 addresses.

IPv4 provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses compared with IPv6:
```
3.4x10**38
```
which is roughly 340 trillion, trillion, trillion addresses.

Example: 2001:0db8:3c4d:0013:0000:0000:2342:56bc
