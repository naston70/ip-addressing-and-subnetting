# IPv4 Addresses - Format

- An IPv4 address has 32 bits, or 4 bytes

- 32 bits equals 2³² different combinations

- Approx 4.3 billion unique addresses

- Example: 01100010 10111100 000100111 01000111

8 bits in each octet, 8 * 4 = 32 bits

01100010 10111100 000100111 01000111
    |	     |	      |		    |	
    98		 188      19        71

IP ADDRESS -> 98.188.19.71

#### Network Portion and Host Portion

example:

A network using 10.0.0.0

3 networks all connect to a router and use the interface they are connecting to the router with as their gateway.

Net 1: 10.0.1.1 network portion is 10.0.1
Net 2: 10.0.2.1 network portion is 10.0.2
Net 3: 10.0.3.1 network portion is 10.0.3

Hosts in Net 1 can expect to receive IP's with 10.0.1.X as their address

Network ID and Broadcast Address:

- A network address is the first IP address in a subnet, a network address has the host portion as all 0's ie 10.0.1.10 (for Net 1)

- A broadcast address is the last IP address in a subnet. Net 1 10.0.1.255 (filled with 1's)

#### How to determine a Network ID address?

***Host Address        :*** 153.0.99.207 /16

***Host Address binary :*** 10011001.00000000.01100011.11001111

***Network Address     :*** 10011001.00000000.00000000.00000000

***Broadcast Address   :*** 10011001.00000000.11111111.11111111
