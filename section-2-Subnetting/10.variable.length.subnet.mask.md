# Variable-Length Subnet Mask - VLSM

The goal of this type of subnetting is to save as many IP's as possible.

- Unlike ***Fixed-Length*** subnetting, ***Variable-Length*** subnetting creates a hierarchical IP address space, making it possible to create subnets without wasting large number of addresses

- Request: create 4 subnets where 3 subnets should have 5 IP addresses each and 1 needs 11 addresses

Subnet 		Hosts		Mask 		Network ID 		Range

1			11			28			192.168.1.0		192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.14
2			5			29			192.168.1.16	192.168.1.17 - 192.168.1.22	
3			5			29			192.168.1.24	192.168.1.25 - 192.168.1.30
4			5			29			192.168.1.32	192.168.1.33 - 192.168.1.38

(Network ID for subnet 2 starts after subnet 1's broadcast)
