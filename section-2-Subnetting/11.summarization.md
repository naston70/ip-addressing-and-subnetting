# Summarization - An example

Networks:

192.168.1.0/28
192.168.1.16/29
192.168.1.24/29
192.168.1.32/29
192.168.1.40/30

How to find the summarization of this network.

Take the highest IP available (in this case 192.168.1.43, after the broadcast IP .42 of the 192.168.1.40 subnet)

Write out the first octet that is different in binary, in this case 192.168.1.00101011 and calculate which bits are the same for all ip addresses in the network. In this case the first 2 bits. So we have 8+8+8 = 24 bits (first 3 octets) + 2 bits (same for all subnets) = 26 and a final route summarization of 192.168.1.0/26
