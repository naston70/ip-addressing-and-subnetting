# Class A - FLSM

**Requirement:** divide a Class A network 50.0.0.0 into two equal networks.


Convert IP to binary:
```
00110010.00000000.00000000.00000000
```
#### NETWORK 1
In order to divide this network we use the first bit after the network portion (The first 0 in the 2nd octet) and move it into the network portion to make /9
For the first usable IP, simply switch the last bit 0 in the last octect.
Last usable address is the opposite. Take the first 9 bits and leave the same. Switch the other bits to 1's and the last 0 to a 1. The broadcast is simply the next IP.

#### NETWORK 2

Switch the 9th bit to a 1 for the second network.
```
00110010.10000000.00000000.00000000
```

Switch the last bit to make the first usable IP and switch all the host bits to create the last usable IP
