Youve been allocated a class B network address of 189.2.0.0. You need to create at least 9 subnets with 64 addresses, 5 subnets with 100 addresses, 13 subnets with 70 addresses.

With FLSM, need to find a subnet to satisfy all requirements.

1. Find a common subnet mask
2. Count number of subnets needed



1) Largest subnet is 100 address (7 bits = 128)

2) Using 7 bits leaves 25 Network bits but we have a class B address so 25-16 = 9 Bits

First 16 bits will never change, 9 bits for subnet and 7 for Hosts

189.2.0.0/25


#### Extra question

Name the first, 11th and last subnet.

1st --> 189.2.0.0

11th -> 189.2.5.0

10111101.00000010.00000101.0|0000000

Using the ninth bit, calculate the 3rd octet as if there were 9 = 10 
To find the 11th subnet, use the octet as usual with 8 bits to make 5

Last -> 

To find the 27th subnet use 26 value in the 9 bit length portion 00001101.0 then convert to correct octet 00001101 = 13 so last subnet is:

189.2.13.0
